This directory contains programs for training and using model of Convolutional Neural Network for differentiating between flowers: Rose, Tulip, Sunflower, Daisy, Dandelion. 


Problems:
Problem noticed during testing is differentiating between roses and tulips. So far all instances of roses were detected as tulips. For better performance different model than vgg19 is required or more data containg roses and tulips. Also changing image preprocessing may help.
